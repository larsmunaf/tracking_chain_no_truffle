# Tracking Chain without Truffle

This project was created for educational purposes. The use case is a delivery or tracking process which is described in this private Blockchain. Basically, there are two smart contracts running. At first, random position data is written into the Blockchain. The second contract constantly listens to events that are emitted at each writing process and keeps us up to date with notifications.

Some automation via ShellScript was done for initial steps instead of using truffle.

## Usage

Both repositories (https://github.com/larsmunaf/tracking_chain) and (https://github.com/larsmunaf/tracking_chain_no_truffle) are needed.
