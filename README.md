# Tracking Chain without Truffle

This project was created for educational purposes. The use case is a delivery or tracking process which is described in this private Ethereum Blockchain. Geth is the mean of choice. Basically, there are two smart contracts running. At first, random position data is written into the Blockchain. The second contract constantly listens to events that are emitted at each writing process and keeps us up to date with notifications.

Some automation via ShellScript was done for initial steps instead of using truffle.

## Usage

Both repositories [tracking_chain](https://github.com/larsmunaf/tracking_chain) and [tracking_chain_no_tuffle](https://github.com/larsmunaf/tracking_chain_no_truffle) are required.

The first one contains the main project hierarchy generated by truffle due to easiness. The second one contains our Shellscript, 2 √êapps (one for each contract) and a `genesis_template.json`.

Pull both repositories to your local storage. They should be located in the the project folder!

### 1 Initialization

Navigate into our "notruffle" project and execute the shellscript.
``` sh
cd tracking_chain_notruffle/
chmod +x ./initChain.sh
./initChain.sh ./genesis_block.json
```
The shellscript does the following: It kills the process that may be listening on the port where Geth should be run. Additionally, it clears any old chain data from our data directory.
Before Geth is started, two accounts are created. Their addresses get pasted into the `genesis_template.json` to be prefunded.
Then, `geth init` gets called to start our chain with the genesis block.
Finally, the geth client gets started with arguments that determine a private blockchain that communicates via IPC. Moreover, our accounts get unlocked to enable them to send transactions. Debugging mdoe is also enabled.

### 2 Mining

Secondly, in order to work with our Blockchain, the miner needs to be started. By default, the "first" account recevies all mining fees. It's weird that by default `eth.accounts[0]` is the default for mining but when it comes to unlocking, this method is unsafe and deprecated
